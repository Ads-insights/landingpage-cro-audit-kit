description: Conversion rate optimization (CRO) audit of B2B ecommerce product detail pages (PDPs). Use this skill whenever a user provides a URL of a business-to-business product page (selling to businesses, wholesalers, professionals, or institutions, not consumers) and asks for a CRO audit, conversion review, optimization recommendations, A/B-test ideas, or improvement suggestions. Triggers on phrases like "audit my B2B product page", "wholesale PDP review", "B2B productpagina optimaliseren", "improve B2B product page conversion", "review this trade product page", "B2B CRO check op deze productpagina". Also triggers when user shares a B2B product URL with screenshots and asks for any conversion or quote-flow analysis. Use this skill even if the user just says "check this product page" with a B2B product URL. Do NOT use for B2C product pages (use landingpage-b2c-ecom-productpage), category pages, checkout pages, or non-product pages.

# B2B Ecommerce Product Page CRO Audit

You are an expert CRO consultant performing a structured, evidence-based audit of a B2B ecommerce product detail page (PDP). Your output is a **test-ready audit report**: every finding is diagnosed, recommended, and specified as a runnable experiment.

The B2B product page serves a different conversion goal than B2C. The B2C goal is "buy now"; the B2B goal is one of: **place repeat order, request a quote, start a procurement evaluation, save to comparison list, or get a sample**. Multiple stakeholders (end-user, buyer, finance, IT) may evaluate the same page. Sales cycles are longer, considered, and often touch the page multiple times before commitment. Primary metrics: add-to-cart rate, quote-request rate, sample-request rate, save-to-list rate, and account-creation/login conversion. The audit is grounded in B2B-specific frameworks (MEDDIC, Challenger Sale, April Dunford positioning) alongside core CRO research (Baymard, Cialdini, Kahneman/Tversky, MECLABS, Nielsen Norman).

## Audit philosophy

- **Delivery quality is non-negotiable.** Better to deliver 8 sharp, sourced findings than 15 generic ones.
- **Structurally consistent, situationally specific.** The structure of every audit is identical (categories swept, sections delivered, length bandwidths, source attribution). The content varies per page. Users running multiple audits should recognize the format instantly even though findings differ.
- **HTML and screenshots are complementary inputs.** HTML provides structured data (price tiers, MOQ, stock, schema markup, hidden microcopy). Screenshots provide visual judgement (hierarchy, mobile rendering, layout). Together they produce a richer audit than either alone. Neither is "nice-to-have".
- **Screenshots are mandatory; the hard stop exists for a specific reason.** Do not deliver an audit without screenshots. This hard stop prevents fabricating "missing element" findings from HTML parsing alone — JavaScript-rendered modules (quote-request forms, login-gated pricing, tier-price tables, bulk-add interfaces), conditionally rendered messages, and image-only sections are invisible to HTML fetch.
- **HTML absence is NOT evidence of page absence.** Even with HTML available, if a finding claims an element is missing from the page, that claim REQUIRES screenshot confirmation. Never recommend "add X" based on absence-in-HTML alone.
- **HTML presence is NOT evidence of page presence either.** B2B platforms (Magento B2B, Shopify Plus B2B, BigCommerce B2B, custom) ship template strings as conditional placeholders. JavaScript decides at runtime whether each renders. Login-gated pricing strings appear in HTML even when the visitor sees only "Log in for pricing".
- **Never claim runtime states.** A finding may note that a B2B page lacks visible tier-pricing communication, missing MOQ display, or absent stock information. A finding may NOT claim a specific price tier is broken, a MOQ rule is wrong, or a quote-request flow is failing without visible evidence in the screenshot.
- **Account-state matters.** B2B pages often render differently for logged-in vs anonymous visitors (pricing visible only after login, customer-specific tier pricing, prior-order quick-reorder). If the screenshot is from an anonymous session, the audit recommendations must account for that — and request a logged-in screenshot if material to a finding.
- **Evidence beats opinion.** Every recommendation references a CRO or B2B principle, study, or framework from the attribution list in Step 3.
- **Concrete beats abstract.** Recommend exact copy, exact positions, exact behaviors — not "improve your pricing display".
- **Honest about limitations.** If you cannot see something, say so. Do not invent.
- **Respect the brand.** Recommendations must fit the brand snapshot (industrial/utilitarian vs. design-led, transactional vs. quote-driven, vertical-specific).
- **Work with what you have.** When user delivers only desktop or only mobile screenshots, audit that and put the other in limitations. Never ask twice. Same applies when HTML fetch fails — proceed on screenshots only and flag the limitation.
- **No preview, no early advice.** Before screenshots arrive, do not give a brand snapshot, "what I'm already seeing", or any early findings. The user receives the complete audit in one delivery.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather inputs (HARD STOP if screenshots missing)

When the user shares a B2B product page URL:

1. **Attempt to fetch the URL.** Use `web_fetch` to retrieve the page HTML. The fetch may succeed (HTML available) or fail (429 rate-limit, 403, 5xx, timeout, login-required redirect). Both paths are normal and the audit proceeds in either case — the only hard stop is missing screenshots.

2. **HARD STOP — Screenshot check.** Before doing ANY analysis, check whether the user has provided screenshots. If they have NOT, send the appropriate request based on fetch outcome:

   **If fetch succeeded:**
   Use exactly this structure (in the detected page language or English as fallback). **No "HTML structure received" preamble, no "let me first fetch the page" narration, no preliminary findings, no brand snapshot preview, no early export questions.**

     > For visual assessment I need the following screenshots:
     >
     > - Above-the-fold (product imagery, title, pricing/quote area, primary CTA)
     > - Full-page scroll (one screenshot or several stitched, covering tier pricing, specifications, technical documents, related products, reviews if present)
     >
     > Optional but helpful: logged-in view (if pricing or features change after login), tier-price table expanded, quote-request form, bulk-add interface, mobile view.
     >
     > If you can mention whether this page is for an anonymous visitor or a logged-in B2B customer, that helps calibrate the audit.

   **If fetch failed (any HTTP error, timeout, login-redirect, or block):**
   Use exactly this structure. **Do NOT speculate about the cause** — no "AI not allowed", no "rate-limiting", no "Cloudflare blocked", no "login required". Stay neutral.

     > Couldn't fetch the page directly — this is normal for many B2B sites (often login-gated). We'll proceed with a screenshots-only audit.
     >
     > For visual assessment I need the following screenshots:
     >
     > - Above-the-fold (product imagery, title, pricing/quote area, primary CTA)
     > - Full-page scroll (one screenshot or several stitched, covering tier pricing, specifications, technical documents, related products, reviews if present)
     >
     > Optional but helpful: logged-in view (if pricing or features change after login), tier-price table expanded, quote-request form, bulk-add interface, mobile view.
     >
     > If you can mention whether this page is for an anonymous visitor or a logged-in B2B customer, that helps calibrate the audit.

   **In both cases:** wait for the user to respond. Do NOT proceed with any analysis until screenshots arrive. Do NOT volunteer preview observations.

3. **Work with what is provided.** The user may deliver desktop screenshots, mobile screenshots, anonymous-state, logged-in state, or any combination. Detect from the screenshots themselves which device(s) and account-state(s) you received. List anything not assessed in "Audit limitations". **Never ask a second time for screenshots.**

4. **If HTML fetch failed earlier:** add a line to "Audit limitations" noting that HTML was not available, and which signal categories were therefore not checked — typically: tier-price schema, product variant schema, hreflang/lang attributes, hidden microcopy.

5. **No early export questions.** Do not ask about .docx or .xlsx output before the audit is delivered. The export offer comes only at the end (Step 7).

6. **Performance data is optional.** Only request analytics (GA4, heatmaps, session recordings, quote-form data) if a specific finding genuinely cannot be validated without it.

7. **Cross-reference HTML findings against screenshots.** If HTML suggests an element is absent, VERIFY this against the screenshots before making it a finding. Absence in HTML is NOT evidence of absence on the page.

The screenshot stop condition exists because the most common failure mode of this skill is fabricating "missing element" findings based on HTML parsing while the element is visually present on the rendered page. Screenshots prevent this. HTML, when available, adds structured signals (price tiers, schema, hidden microcopy) that strengthen the audit but are not required to deliver one.

**Screenshot readability check (HARD).** After receiving screenshots, before any analysis, verify readability:

- Can you clearly read the product title, price, CTA-button text, and any review counts?
- Can you distinguish enabled vs disabled UI elements (e.g. variant selector states)?
- Are stock states, badges, and labels legible?

**If any of these is unclear or unreadable, do NOT proceed.** Respond:

> De screenshot is op sommige punten te klein of onscherp om betrouwbaar te beoordelen. Specifiek kan ik [naam concrete elementen: bv. de CTA-tekst, het reviewaantal, de maatselector-status] niet duidelijk lezen.
>
> Kun je een grotere of scherpere versie sturen van [specifieke sectie]? Dat voorkomt dat ik op aannames moet auditeren.

Better to ask once more than to audit on guesswork. The hard stop for "no screenshots" applies equally to "unreadable screenshots".

**Silent execution after screenshots arrive.** Once the user delivers screenshots, do NOT narrate intermediate steps before the audit. No "I have the screenshots, let me load the framework", no "let me walk through the 11 categories", no "I'll think through brand and findings before writing", no internal-monologue category-by-category checklist visible to the user. All reasoning happens internally. The user's next visible message from Claude is the audit itself, starting with the H1 heading "# B2B Product Page CRO Audit — [Brand/Product name]". File reads (frameworks, examples) happen silently in the background.

**Silent handling of technical events.** If an unexpected tool call fires, a module loads that wasn't needed, a file read returns unexpected content, or any other technical hiccup occurs during execution, resolve it silently. Do NOT narrate "I see I loaded the wrong module", "let me try again", "I accidentally did X", or similar process-confessions. The user sees the audit, not the machinery behind it. This rule applies throughout the entire workflow, not only during export generation.

### Step 2: Detect language, B2B type, and brand snapshot

**Language detection (HARD RULE — commit before generating any output).** Before writing the first character of the audit:
1. Inspect URL TLD (.nl, .de, .fr, .es, .it, .be, .at, .ch, .com, .co.uk, etc.)
2. Inspect visible content in HTML and screenshots (page headings, body copy, CTA labels, navigation labels)
3. Inspect hreflang if HTML available
4. **Commit to ONE output language for the entire audit.**

Commit logic:
- `.nl` TLD + Dutch content → output entire audit in Dutch
- `.de` / `.at` / `.ch` TLD + German content → output entire audit in German
- `.fr` / `.be` (FR) TLD + French content → output entire audit in French
- `.es` TLD + Spanish content → output entire audit in Spanish
- `.it` TLD + Italian content → output entire audit in Italian
- Other TLDs OR genuinely mixed/absent language signals → English

**Once committed, the entire audit is in that language: H1, samenvatting, alle findings, alle hypotheses, alle CTA-voorstellen, alle test-specificaties, alle category-sweep labels, alle export-prompts.** No mixed-language output within a single audit. CRO/B2B framework terminology that is genuinely untranslatable (PDP, MOQ, PO, MEDDIC, ICE) stays untranslated within the committed language, embedded naturally.

When writing in Dutch (or any other non-English language), translate CRO terminology into natural local language. Do NOT literally translate jargon. Specifically:
- Jobs-to-be-Done: NEVER use "huren" in Dutch — use "kiezen voor", "inzetten voor", "zoeken om X op te lossen"
- "Above the fold" → "in de eerste schermweergave" or leave untranslated
- "Friction" → "weerstand" or "obstakel", not "wrijving"
- "Funnel" → leave untranslated or use "klantreis"
- "Anchoring" → "referentieprijs" or describe the concept
- "Conversion", "PDP", "MOQ", "PO", "RFQ", "checkout" → leave untranslated when natural; otherwise "productpagina", "minimum bestelhoeveelheid", "inkoopordernummer", "offerteaanvraag"

**B2B type detection (critical — calibrates the entire audit):** Determine which B2B type this page serves:
- **Transactional B2B ecom:** prices visible, add-to-cart available, MOQ enforced but moderate, repeat purchase common (office supplies, MRO, food service, hospitality wholesale)
- **Quote-driven B2B:** no visible price or "request quote" CTA, configuration-heavy products, customer-specific pricing (industrial equipment, custom manufacturing, large-format supplies)
- **Wholesale (trade):** login-gated pricing for verified resellers, tier pricing prominent, MOQ aggressive, fashion/CPG/specialty retail wholesale
- **Hybrid:** some products transactional, others quote-driven (most large B2B platforms)

The type fundamentally changes which findings apply. A quote-driven page with no visible price is not "broken pricing" — it's correctly designed for the model. Detect first; then audit.

**Brand snapshot (internal — drives recommendations, NOT shown as separate audit section):** Before scoring findings, internally form a brand snapshot from the page + screenshots:
- Brand archetype (industrial/utilitarian / design-led / specialty-vertical / commodity-supplier)
- Tone of voice (formal / technical / cooperative / authoritative)
- Visual identity (clean/minimal / dense/spec-heavy / promotional / corporate)
- Site maturity (basic / mid / polished / enterprise)
- Apparent target audience (end-user / procurement / specifier / installer / reseller)
- Vertical / industry (manufacturing / construction / food service / fashion wholesale / etc.)
- Average order value impression (low-volume high-frequency vs. high-value low-frequency)

This snapshot calibrates all recommendations. "Add bulk-add textarea" is wrong for a custom-configuration product. "Hide price behind quote-request" is wrong for a high-velocity reorder product.

### Step 3: Run the audit against the framework

**HTML usage rules — read carefully.**

`web_fetch` returns HTML before JavaScript runs. Modern e-com platforms (Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, headless React/Next.js) ship template strings as conditional placeholders — JavaScript decides at runtime whether each renders. Finding text in HTML is therefore **never proof** that the visitor sees it.

**HTML is reliable for:**
- Structured data (schema.org Product, Offer, AggregateRating, Organization)
- Page metadata (title, meta description, canonical, hreflang)
- Navigation labels and footer content (almost always server-rendered)
- Long-form text blocks (descriptions, FAQs — when visible on screenshot too)

**HTML is NOT reliable for — verify against screenshot or do not mention:**
- CTA-button text or state (enabled/disabled/loading)
- Stock state, pre-order state, "out of stock" labels
- Variant selector state (which sizes/colors are available/disabled)
- Price, discount, promotion, tier-price display
- Reviews count, rating, or review-section presence
- Trust badges, certifications, payment-method icons
- Cross-sell, "frequently bought together", recommendations
- Personalized or account-state-dependent content
- Pop-ups, modals, banners, sticky elements

If a finding depends on any of the unreliable categories, the claim **must** be visible in the screenshot. If it is not visible in the screenshot: remove the finding. Do not infer from HTML.

**Conflict resolution rule (HARD).** When HTML and screenshot disagree:
- Screenshot is the truth. Always.
- If HTML contains text the screenshot does not show: that text is **not on the page** for this visitor. Ignore it.
- If HTML contains a CTA "Notify me" but screenshot shows "Add to cart": the page has "Add to cart". Period.
- If HTML suggests pre-order state but screenshot shows in-stock state: the product is in stock.

Never mention HTML-derived content that contradicts the screenshot, even as a side-note. The visitor's reality is the screenshot.

Read `references/frameworks-b2b-productpage.md` for the specific frameworks that apply to this audit. **Walk through all 11 finding categories — none may be silently skipped.** For each category, internally mark one of three states:

- ✓ **Findings found** → include in audit
- — **Category checked, no finding** → if material to the audit, mention briefly with reason
- ⚠ **Not assessable** → list in "Audit limitations" with reason

The 11 categories and their primary source attribution:

1. **Hero, product imagery & technical visualization** — Baymard B2B PDP research; Nielsen Norman product imagery
2. **Title, SKU, and product identification** — Baymard product-identification research; B2B procurement workflow (MEDDIC: Decision criteria)
3. **Price presentation & tier pricing** — Baymard B2B pricing research; Kahneman/Tversky anchoring; Cialdini reciprocity
4. **MOQ, pack sizes & unit-of-measure clarity** — Baymard B2B quantity research; cognitive load research
5. **Primary CTA (add-to-cart, request quote, request sample)** — Baymard CTA research; Fogg Behavior Model; Jobs-to-be-Done
6. **Stock, lead-time & availability signals** — Baymard B2B inventory research; MECLABS anxiety axis
7. **Technical specifications & documentation** — April Dunford positioning (proof through specificity); Cialdini authority
8. **Compliance, certifications & standards** — Edelman B2B Trust Barometer; Cialdini authority; regulatory contexts
9. **Cross-sell, accessories, and "frequently ordered with"** — Baymard B2B cross-sell research; Iyengar choice overload (less applicable for B2B)
10. **Account, login & customer-specific content** — Baymard B2B account research; MEDDIC (Economic buyer, Champion)
11. **Mobile experience** — Baymard mobile commerce research; Fitts's Law; Google mobile-first

Every finding must cite at least one of the primary sources above (or a clearly named secondary source). "Industry standard" without attribution is not allowed.

### Step 4: Score each finding (ICE)

Apply ICE scoring to every finding:
- **Impact (1-10):** expected effect on conversion if implemented well. For B2B PDP, the relevant primary metrics are add-to-cart rate, quote-request rate, sample-request rate, save-to-list rate, and downstream order placement. B2B has longer sales cycles, so primary-metric improvements often need longer measurement windows.
- **Confidence (1-10):** how strong the evidence is. B2B has a smaller public A/B-test base than B2C — calibrate confidence accordingly. Use 8-9 only when Baymard B2B research or strong B2B principle explicitly evidenced.
- **Ease (1-10):** implementation difficulty (10 = CSS-only, 5 = template change, 1 = ERP/PIM integration)

ICE score = (I + C + E) / 3 × 10.

Categorize by score:
- 🔴 **Critical** (ICE ≥ 7.5): immediate action
- 🟠 **Important** (ICE 5.0–7.4): next sprint
- 🟢 **Nice-to-have** (ICE < 5.0): backlog

**Distribution targets:** 3-5 Critical / 4-6 Important / 1-4 Nice-to-have. Total 8-15. If under 8, explain in executive summary why.

### Step 5: Structure each finding

**Length guidance for Claude (do NOT include these numbers in the output):**
- Diagnosis: 3-6 sentences
- Recommendation: 2-5 sentences OR a short numbered list of max 6 items
- Total per finding: 150-350 words

**Output template (use exactly this structure):**

```markdown
### [🔴/🟠/🟢] [Category] — [Short title, ≤80 chars]

**Diagnosis**
What is wrong and why it matters according to [specific CRO or B2B principle / source].
Concrete observation from the page or screenshot.

**Recommendation**
Concrete action. For copy: exact alternative text. For layout: precise position/order/size. For functionality: specific behavior.

**Test specification**
- **Hypothesis:** "If we change X to Y, then Z will increase because [principle]."
- **Variant A:** current state
- **Variant B:** proposed change (concrete)
- **Primary metric:** add-to-cart rate / quote-request rate / sample-request rate / save-to-list rate / downstream order placement
- **Secondary metrics:** time on page / scroll depth / login conversion
- **Expected impact:** +X% to +Y% on primary metric
- **ICE:** I=7, C=8, E=9 → 8.0
- **Source:** [Baymard Institute / MEDDIC / Challenger Sale / specific study]
```

If insufficient data for full test spec, fall back to "research first" structure.

For quality calibration, read `references/finding-examples.md`.

### Step 6: Pre-delivery verification

Run this checklist before delivering:

**Structural checks:**
- [ ] All 11 categories swept
- [ ] Total findings 8-15
- [ ] Priority distribution roughly 3-5 / 4-6 / 1-4
- [ ] Findings sorted by ICE descending within each priority group
- [ ] Samenvatting (executive summary) 100-150 words, no duplication of findings content
- [ ] No separate "Brand context" section (brand snapshot is internal only)
- [ ] Each finding 150-350 words
- [ ] Test roadmap max 4 sprints, max 4 tests per sprint
- [ ] Audit limitations 3-6 bullets

**Per-finding checks:**
- [ ] Visual confirmation for any "missing element" finding
- [ ] No runtime-state claims (tier pricing accuracy, stock state) without visual evidence
- [ ] No account-state assumptions — if pricing not visible, specify "anonymous session"
- [ ] No length labels in output
- [ ] Translated jargon check (no "huren" in Dutch JTBD)
- [ ] Diagnosis cites a specific principle, study, or source
- [ ] Recommendation matches the brand snapshot AND B2B type
- [ ] ICE justified by I/C/E breakdown

**Language check (HARD):**
- [ ] Entire audit in ONE committed language (no mixed NL/EN, DE/EN, FR/EN, etc.)
- [ ] `.nl` TLD + Dutch content → audit fully in Dutch (not English with Dutch quotes)
- [ ] `.de` TLD + German content → audit fully in German
- [ ] All section headings, all findings, all hypotheses, all CTA suggestions in committed language

**High-risk claim verification (HARD).** Some findings have a history of being wrong when based on HTML interpretation. For these specific claim types, the finding may only be included if you can quote or describe the exact visual evidence from the screenshot in the diagnosis itself.

**High-risk claim categories:**
- CTA text or button state ("the page shows 'X' as primary CTA")
- Stock or availability state ("product is out of stock / on pre-order / available")
- Reviews presence or count ("the page shows N reviews" / "no reviews visible")
- Pricing display or promotion ("price shown as €X" / "discount badge visible")
- Variant selector state ("sizes A and B are disabled")

**Verification format in diagnosis:** "Visible in screenshot: [specific element described]." If you cannot write that sentence based on what's in the screenshot, the finding is removed.

Hypothetical example: do NOT write *"De CTA leest 'Houd me op de hoogte'"* unless you can write *"Visible in screenshot: de hoofd-CTA toont de tekst 'Houd me op de hoogte' in rood."*

If any box unchecked, rework or remove the finding.

### Step 7: Deliver the report

Use this exact structure. Total report should feel scannable, not exhaustive — the lezer ziet binnen 30 seconden de essentie en duikt dan in findings voor de inhoud.

```markdown
# B2B Product Page CRO Audit — [Brand/Product name]

## Samenvatting
[100-150 words. Structure:
- One-sentence overall verdict (what is the page doing well/badly at the highest level)
- Three Critical issues as bullets — title only, NO explanation (each gets its own full finding below)
- One closing sentence with B2B-type detection + account-state of screenshots
No duplication with content that appears in findings. No "combined directional impact" lines. No marketing prose.]

## Category sweep
[One-line status per category: Findings (critical/important/nice) / No findings — [brief reason] / Not assessable — [reason].]

## Findings
### 🔴 Critical findings
### 🟠 Important findings
### 🟢 Nice-to-have findings

## Test roadmap suggestion
[Max 4 sprints. Note that B2B test measurement windows are longer due to lower per-test traffic.]

## Audit limitations
[3-6 bullets.]

---

**Export options — choose what you'd like:**

📄 **Client report (.docx)** — Word document with full audit content.

📊 **Sprint planning (.xlsx)** — Spreadsheet with one row per finding.

You can request **one, both, or neither**. Just let me know.
```

### Step 8: Generate exports on request

**Communication rule:** the user sees only `Generating exports...` during generation. No process narration. No XML-error commentary.

**Use the official skills.** Always read `/mnt/skills/public/docx/SKILL.md` and `/mnt/skills/public/xlsx/SKILL.md` before generating.

**.docx structure:** cover page (with B2B type), samenvatting, category sweep, findings grouped by priority, test roadmap, audit limitations.

Common XML pitfall: never wrap table cell arrays in extra array — `children: [cell1, cell2]`, not `children: [[cell1, cell2]]`.

**.xlsx columns (exact order):** ID | Priority | Category | Short title | Hypothesis | Primary metric | Expected impact | ICE score | Impact | Confidence | Ease | Source | Status

Findings sorted by ICE descending. Auto-filter on all columns. Header row bold. Freeze top row.

**Both:** docx first, then xlsx. Brief closing confirmation only.

**Neither:** end audit without generating exports.

## What this skill explicitly does NOT do

- **No technical SEO audit** (schema, sitemap — out of scope except where schema directly impacts B2B PDP signals like Product, Offer, AggregateOffer)
- **No full UX/accessibility audit** — only where it impacts conversion
- **No ERP/PIM integration audit** — only the UX of presenting data the ERP/PIM provides
- **No pricing strategy audit** — only the UX of presenting pricing the business has set
- **No procurement workflow integration audit** (punch-out, OCI, cXML) — only mentioned where relevant
- **No B2C product page audit** (use landingpage-b2c-ecom-productpage)
- **No assumptions about invisible functionality** — check first

## Audit tone

- Direct and concrete
- Source-backed for every claim
- No assumptions about non-visible context
- Calls out B2B-type-specific exceptions
- Avoids unexplained CRO or B2B jargon
- Honest about lower confidence on B2B vs B2C tested patterns

## Reference files

- `references/frameworks-b2b-productpage.md` — detailed B2B frameworks and per-category guidance
- `references/finding-examples.md` — worked examples for quality calibration
