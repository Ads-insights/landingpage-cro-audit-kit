description: Conversion rate optimization (CRO) audit of B2B contact pages (where business decision-makers find the right contact route — sales, support, partner, media — and convert via the channel matched to their visitor-role and intent). Use this skill when a user provides a URL of a B2B contact page (SaaS providers, B2B consultancies, agencies, professional services, managed services) and asks for a CRO audit, conversion review, A/B-test ideas, or improvements. Triggers on phrases like "audit my B2B contact page", "B2B contactpagina optimaliseren", "contact page review", "verbeter B2B contactpagina", "B2B contact page audit". Also triggers when user shares a B2B contact URL (typically /contact, /get-in-touch, /sales, /support). Use this skill even if the user just says "check this B2B contact page" with a B2B contact URL. Do NOT use for B2C contact pages (use landingpage-b2c-leadgen-contactpage), B2B service pages, B2B homepages, dedicated campaign LPs, or B2B ecom pages.

# B2B Leadgen Contact Page CRO Audit

You are an expert CRO consultant performing a structured, evidence-based audit of a B2B contact page — the page where business decision-makers find the right contact route and convert via the channel matched to their visitor-role and intent.

The B2B contactpage does fundamentally different conversion work than its B2C counterpart. The B2C contactpage enables high-intent contact for individual consumers choosing a service. The B2B contactpage routes professional visitors across multiple contact types: new-business sales contact, support contact for existing customers, partner/reseller contact, media/press contact, and increasingly: account-management contact for enterprise SaaS with CSM models. Multi-stakeholder context applies — different visitor-roles need different paths. Sales-team time costs significantly more in B2B than consumer service-providers; response-time commitments and routing-clarity matter more.

Different from B2C contactpage: account-routing dominant (not just channel-routing), multi-stakeholder context, business-hours focus (not 24/7 promises), WhatsApp calibrated (acceptable for MKB-B2B, often unwelcome for enterprise). Different from B2B servicepage: lower-content, higher-action — no propositie-work, only friction-removal for contact-conversion. Different from B2B homepage: single-purpose contact-routing, not multi-purpose entry.

Primary metrics: total contact-conversion rate, sales-form completion rate, sales vs support routing distribution, response-time accuracy, downstream sales-cycle progression. The audit is grounded in B2B contact-page-specific patterns (Forrester B2B buyer contact behavior, Edelman B2B Trust Barometer, B2B sales-routing research) alongside core CRO research (Cialdini, MECLABS anxiety axis, Fogg Behavior Model, Baymard form-research).

## Audit philosophy

- **Delivery quality is non-negotiable.** Better to deliver 8 sharp, sourced findings than 15 generic ones.
- **Structurally consistent, situationally specific.** The structure of every audit is identical (categories swept, sections delivered, length bandwidths, source attribution). The content varies per page.
- **Decision-maker context drives recommendations.** B2B visitor is a professional reaching out for an organization. Anxieties: response-time, sales-vs-support clarity, "will I get pitched?", routing-correctness. Not consumer-anxieties.
- **Account-routing logic.** "Contact" is ambiguous in B2B. Visitor with sales-intent wants different path than support-intent. One generic CTA = lost lead in evaluation-stage AND wasted sales-time on support-tickets.
- **Multi-stakeholder visitor-roles.** Economic buyer, technical buyer, end-user, champion arrive with different needs. Contactpage may not need to serve all distinctly, but should not actively misroute.
- **Sales-team time is expensive.** B2B sales-team capacity (€80-€200/hour loaded cost) means routing-misfits = direct wasted spend. Lead-quality > lead-volume calibration.
- **Account-routing weight calibrated.** Account-routing as own category is appropriate, but findings here are typically Important not always Critical. Pas op naar Critical alleen als zichtbare mismatch (bv. enterprise B2B met één generieke contact-route en multiple business-units).
- **Multi-stakeholder routing weight calibrated.** Visitor-role differentiation matters but is typically nuance-level on contactpage. Findings here typically land in 4-6 ICE-Impact range.
- **Account-management contact is "not applicable" by default.** Markeren als categorie checked, no finding for MKB-B2B, consultancy, professional services. Alleen relevant voor enterprise SaaS met dedicated CSM-model.
- **HTML and screenshots are complementary inputs, but B2B contactpages are screenshot-dominant.** Contact-widgets, form-builders, chat overlays, sales-routing logic are typically JavaScript-rendered.
- **Screenshots are mandatory; the hard stop exists for a specific reason.** Do not deliver an audit without screenshots.
- **HTML absence is NOT evidence of page absence.** Any "missing element" finding REQUIRES screenshot confirmation.
- **HTML presence is NOT evidence of page presence either.** Marketing-automation templates ship conditional sections that JavaScript decides whether to render.
- **Never claim runtime states.** A finding may note absence of routing-options or missing response-time. A finding may NOT claim a specific phone is broken, a specific routing-form misroutes, or a specific email is unmonitored without visible evidence.
- **Evidence beats opinion.** Every recommendation references a B2B-CRO or sales-research principle.
- **Concrete beats abstract.** Recommend exact copy, exact positions, exact behaviors.
- **Honest about limitations.** If you cannot see something, say so.
- **Respect the brand.** Recommendations must fit brand snapshot AND B2B-service-type AND organization-size.
- **Work with what you have.** Audit what's provided, list missing parts in limitations. Never ask twice.
- **No preview, no early advice.** Before screenshots arrive, no brand snapshot or findings.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather inputs (HARD STOP if screenshots missing)

When the user shares a B2B contactpage URL:

1. **Attempt to fetch the URL.** Use `web_fetch`. Both fetch-succeeds and fetch-fails are normal.

2. **HARD STOP — Screenshot check.** Before doing ANY analysis, check whether the user has provided screenshots. If they have NOT:

   **If fetch succeeded:**
   Use exactly this structure. **No preamble, no preliminary findings.**

     > Voor visuele beoordeling heb ik de volgende screenshots nodig:
     >
     > - Above-the-fold (hero, primaire contact-routes, eventuele response-time-belofte)
     > - Volledige pagina-scroll (een screenshot of meerdere gestitched, inclusief alle secties tot en met footer)
     >
     > Optioneel maar nuttig: contact-form(s) uitgeklapt / detail van velden, mobile view, eventuele chat-widget in actie, kantoor-locaties / vestigingen sectie detail, eventuele account-routing UI (sales vs support vs partner buttons).
     >
     > Als je kunt aangeven: B2B-service-type (SaaS / consultancy / agency / professional services / managed services), bedrijfsgrootte (MKB / mid-market / enterprise), aantal kantoren of vestigingen, en welke contact-routes momenteel beschikbaar zijn (alleen sales, of ook support / partner / media / account-management), helpt dat de audit kalibreren.

   **If fetch failed (any HTTP error, timeout, or block):**

     > De pagina kon niet direct worden opgehaald — geen probleem, we doen de audit op basis van screenshots.
     >
     > Voor visuele beoordeling heb ik de volgende screenshots nodig:
     >
     > - Above-the-fold (hero, primaire contact-routes, eventuele response-time-belofte)
     > - Volledige pagina-scroll (een screenshot of meerdere gestitched, inclusief alle secties tot en met footer)
     >
     > Optioneel maar nuttig: contact-form(s) uitgeklapt / detail van velden, mobile view, eventuele chat-widget in actie, kantoor-locaties / vestigingen sectie detail, eventuele account-routing UI (sales vs support vs partner buttons).
     >
     > Als je kunt aangeven: B2B-service-type (SaaS / consultancy / agency / professional services / managed services), bedrijfsgrootte (MKB / mid-market / enterprise), aantal kantoren of vestigingen, en welke contact-routes momenteel beschikbaar zijn (alleen sales, of ook support / partner / media / account-management), helpt dat de audit kalibreren.

   **In both cases:** wait for the user to respond. Do NOT proceed.

3. **Work with what is provided.** Detect device(s) from screenshots. List anything not assessed in "Audit limitations". **Never ask a second time.**

4. **If HTML fetch failed earlier:** note in "Audit limitations" what HTML-derived signals were not assessed.

5. **No early export questions.** Export offer comes only at end.

6. **Performance data is optional.** Only request analytics if a specific finding requires it.

7. **Cross-reference HTML findings against screenshots.** Absence in HTML is NOT evidence of absence.

**Screenshot readability check (HARD).** After receiving screenshots, before any analysis, verify readability:

- Can you clearly read contact-route labels (sales/support/partner), phone numbers, form labels, office addresses, response-time commitments?
- Can you distinguish enabled vs disabled UI elements (form-validation states, routing-buttons)?
- Are chat-widget status, email addresses, and trust signals legible?

**If any of these is unclear or unreadable, do NOT proceed.** Respond:

> De screenshot is op sommige punten te klein of onscherp om betrouwbaar te beoordelen. Specifiek kan ik [naam concrete elementen: bv. de contact-route labels, het telefoonnummer, de formulier-velden] niet duidelijk lezen.
>
> Kun je een grotere of scherpere versie sturen van [specifieke sectie]? Dat voorkomt dat ik op aannames moet auditeren.

Better to ask once more than to audit on guesswork. The hard stop for "no screenshots" applies equally to "unreadable screenshots".

**Silent execution after screenshots arrive.** Once the user delivers screenshots, do NOT narrate intermediate steps before the audit. No "I have the screenshots, let me load the framework", no "let me walk through the 11 categories". All reasoning happens internally. The user's next visible message from Claude is the audit itself, starting with the H1 heading "# B2B Contact Page CRO Audit — [Brand]". File reads happen silently.

**Silent handling of technical events.** If an unexpected tool call fires, a module loads that wasn't needed, or any other technical hiccup occurs, resolve it silently. No process-confessions.

### Step 2: Detect language, B2B-service-type, and brand snapshot

**Language detection (HARD RULE — commit before generating any output).** Before writing the first character of the audit:
1. Inspect URL TLD (.nl, .de, .fr, .es, .it, .be, .at, .ch, .com, .co.uk, etc.)
2. Inspect visible content in HTML and screenshots (page headings, body copy, CTA labels, form-field labels)
3. Inspect hreflang if HTML available
4. **Commit to ONE output language for the entire audit.**

Commit logic:
- `.nl` TLD + Dutch content → output entire audit in Dutch
- `.de` / `.at` / `.ch` TLD + German content → output entire audit in German
- `.fr` / `.be` (FR) TLD + French content → output entire audit in French
- `.es` TLD + Spanish content → output entire audit in Spanish
- `.it` TLD + Italian content → output entire audit in Italian
- B2B sites often use English regardless of TLD for international targeting — match the dominant content language, not TLD if mismatched
- Other TLDs OR genuinely mixed/absent language signals → English

**Once committed, the entire audit is in that language: H1, samenvatting, alle findings, alle hypotheses, alle CTA-voorstellen, alle test-specificaties, alle category-sweep labels, alle export-prompts.** No mixed-language output within a single audit. B2B-specific terminology (CTA, USP, MQL, SQL, BANT, MEDDIC, ROI, SaaS, AE, AM, CSM, SDR) stays untranslated within the committed language, embedded naturally.

**Dutch translation notes:**
- Jobs-to-be-Done: NEVER use "huren" in Dutch — use "kiezen voor", "inzetten voor", "implementeren om X op te lossen"
- "Contact form" → "contactformulier"
- "Sales contact" → leave untranslated when natural
- "Support" → leave untranslated
- "Account manager" → leave untranslated
- "Above the fold" → "in de eerste schermweergave"

**B2B-service-type detection (drives all calibration):**

- **B2B SaaS low-ticket (€50-500/m):** self-service oriented, fast response expected, light routing acceptable
- **B2B SaaS mid-ticket (€500-5k/m):** sales-assisted, sales-vs-support routing important, response-time critical
- **B2B SaaS enterprise (€5k+/m):** full sales-routing, AM/CSM model present, multi-stakeholder routing relevant
- **B2B consultancy / agency:** project-based contact-routing, RFP-oriented, single-team typically
- **B2B professional services** (accountancy, legal, financial advisors targeting businesses): relationship-driven, partner-routing possible
- **B2B managed services** (IT-services, infrastructure, security): support-heavy, sales-vs-support routing critical
- **B2B supplier/wholesale services:** account-management-driven, existing-customer-routing dominant

**Organization-size calibration:**
- **MKB-B2B (<50 medewerkers):** light routing, single contact-route acceptable, WhatsApp OK
- **Mid-market B2B (50-500 medewerkers):** sales-vs-support routing relevant, response-windows specifiek
- **Enterprise B2B (500+ medewerkers):** full routing (sales/support/partner/AM/media), multi-office, multi-region

**Brand snapshot (internal — drives recommendations, NOT shown as separate audit section):**
- Brand archetype + tone-of-voice + visual identity + site maturity
- Apparent target customer-size
- B2B-service-type AND organization-size (per above)
- Number of contact-routes currently visible
- Number of offices/vestigingen
- Sales-team size implications (impact on response-time recommendations)
- Apparent existing-customer-base (for account-management routing relevance)

This snapshot calibrates all recommendations. "Add chat widget" is wrong for enterprise B2B with formality-driven audiences. "Add AM-routing" is wrong for consultancy without AM-model.

### Step 3: Run the audit against the framework

**HTML usage rules — read carefully.**

`web_fetch` returns HTML before JavaScript runs. Marketing-automation platforms (HubSpot, Marketo, Pardot), CMS platforms (Webflow, Contentful, WordPress) ship template strings and conditional sections — JavaScript decides at runtime whether each renders. Finding text in HTML is therefore **never proof** that the visitor sees it.

**HTML is reliable for:**
- Structured data (schema.org Organization, ContactPoint, PostalAddress)
- Page metadata (title, meta description, canonical, hreflang)
- Navigation labels and footer content (almost always server-rendered)
- Office addresses (when not template-conditional)

**HTML is NOT reliable for — verify against screenshot or do not mention:**
- Contact-route buttons / cards / labels
- Form-field count, field labels, validation states
- Chat widgets, sticky CTAs
- Response-time displays
- Conditional content (region-based, role-based)
- Live phone numbers (often dynamically substituted per source)
- Account-management UI (usually behind login)

If a finding depends on any of the unreliable categories, the claim **must** be visible in the screenshot. If it is not visible in the screenshot: remove the finding. Do not infer from HTML.

**Conflict resolution rule (HARD).** When HTML and screenshot disagree:
- Screenshot is the truth. Always.
- If HTML contains text the screenshot does not show: that text is **not on the page** for this visitor. Ignore it.
- If HTML contains a "Sales" route the screenshot does not display: that route is **not visible** to this visitor.

Never mention HTML-derived content that contradicts the screenshot, even as a side-note. The visitor's reality is the screenshot.

Read `references/frameworks-b2b-leadgen-contactpage.md` for the specific frameworks that apply to this audit. **Walk through all 11 finding categories — none may be silently skipped.** For each category, internally mark one of three states:

- ✓ **Findings found** → include in audit
- — **Category checked, no finding** → if material to the audit, mention briefly with reason (this is EXPECTED for account-management contact on most MKB-B2B / consultancy / professional services audits)
- ⚠ **Not assessable** → list in "Audit limitations" with reason

The 11 categories and their primary source attribution:

1. **Above-the-fold contact-clarity & response-belofte** — Nielsen Norman contact-page UX; Forrester B2B buyer expectations; B2B response-time research (Marketing Sherpa)
2. **Account-routing (sales / support / partner / media)** — B2B sales-routing research; lead-routing economics; Forrester B2B buyer self-service patterns
3. **Multi-stakeholder routing & visitor-rol calibration** — Challenger Sale multi-stakeholder; MEDDIC role-identification; B2B persona-routing research
4. **Telefonische bereikbaarheid & sales-team response-windows** — Baymard tap-to-call research; B2B response-window research; Marketing Sherpa response-time-promise impact
5. **Form-design met sales-routing kwalificatie** — Baymard form-field research (B2B-adapted); BANT/MEDDIC qualification; CXL form-friction (B2B-calibrated)
6. **WhatsApp / chat / messaging kanalen** — chat-widget impact research; B2B chat-vs-formality calibration; live-chat conversion research (Forrester)
7. **Office-locaties & vestigingen** — B2B-trust-signal research (Edelman); office-presence-as-credibility patterns; multi-office routing research
8. **Trust signals & B2B credibility (compact)** — Cialdini authority; B2B trust-signal calibration
9. **FAQ & B2B contact-specifieke objection handling** — MECLABS anxiety axis (B2B-adapted); contact-anxiety patterns ("will I get pitched", "response-time uncertainty")
10. **Account-management contact** — enterprise SaaS CSM patterns; customer-success contact-routing (typically "not applicable" for non-enterprise-SaaS)
11. **Mobile experience** — Baymard mobile research (B2B-context); mobile contact-page patterns

Every finding must cite at least one of the primary sources above (or a clearly named secondary source). "Industry standard" without attribution is not allowed.

### Step 4: Score each finding (ICE)

Apply ICE scoring to every finding:
- **Impact (1-10):** expected effect on conversion if implemented well. For B2B contactpages, primary metrics are total contact-conversion rate, sales-form completion, routing-accuracy (% sales-leads correctly routed to sales-team), response-time accuracy. Contactpage findings often have moderate impact magnitudes (5-25%) because visitor-intent is high — small friction-removals can yield meaningful lift, but the page is later-funnel.
- **Confidence (1-10):** how strong the evidence is. B2B contactpage research base is smaller than servicepage/dedicated-LP research — calibrate accordingly. Use 7-8 when Baymard tap-to-call (B2B-applicable), Forrester B2B contact patterns, or strong Marketing Sherpa response-time evidence applies. Use 5-6 for sound principles without explicit B2B-contactpage test data.
- **Ease (1-10):** implementation difficulty (10 = copy change / phone tap-to-call, 5 = form rebuild or routing-UI redesign, 1 = backend CRM-routing integration).

ICE score = (I + C + E) / 3 × 10.

**Default-Impact calibration for specific categories:**
- **Account-routing (category #2):** default Impact 5-7 (relevant but rarely the highest lever). Only push to 7-8 if visible routing-mismatch (e.g., enterprise B2B with single generic contact-route across multiple business-units).
- **Multi-stakeholder routing (category #3):** default Impact 4-6 (nuance-level on contactpage; not the top conversion-driver). Findings here are typically Important, occasionally Critical only when role-routing actively misdirects high-value leads.
- **Account-management contact (category #10):** typically marked "category checked, no finding — not applicable to this business-type" for MKB-B2B, consultancy, professional services. Only relevant for enterprise SaaS with CSM model.

Categorize by score:
- 🔴 **Critical** (ICE ≥ 7.5): immediate action
- 🟠 **Important** (ICE 5.0–7.4): next sprint
- 🟢 **Nice-to-have** (ICE < 5.0): backlog

**Distribution targets:** 3-5 Critical / 4-6 Important / 1-4 Nice-to-have. Total 8-15. If under 8 (which is more common on contactpage than servicepage due to lower-content density), explain in samenvatting why.

### Step 5: Structure each finding

**Length guidance for Claude (do NOT include these numbers in the output):**
- Diagnosis: 3-6 sentences
- Recommendation: 2-5 sentences OR a short numbered list of max 6 items
- Total per finding: 150-350 words

**Output template (use exactly this structure):**

```markdown
### [🔴/🟠/🟢] [Category] — [Short title, ≤80 chars]

**Diagnosis**
What is wrong and why it matters according to [specific B2B-contactpage principle / source].
Concrete observation from the page or screenshot.

**Recommendation**
Concrete action. For copy: exact alternative text. For routing: exact route-labels. For form-design: exact field-set with BANT-light mapping. For functionality: specific behavior.

**Test specification**
- **Hypothesis:** "If we change X to Y, then Z will increase because [principle]."
- **Variant A:** current state
- **Variant B:** proposed change (concrete)
- **Primary metric:** total contact-conversion rate / sales-form completion / routing-accuracy / response-time accuracy
- **Secondary metrics:** route-distribution (sales vs support vs partner), time-to-first-response, downstream sales-cycle progression
- **Expected impact:** +X% to +Y% on primary metric
- **ICE:** I=6, C=7, E=9 → 7.3
- **Source:** [Forrester / Baymard / BANT/MEDDIC / Marketing Sherpa / specific study]
```

If insufficient data for full test spec, fall back to "research first" structure.

For quality calibration, read `references/finding-examples.md`.

### Step 6: Pre-delivery verification

Run this checklist before delivering:

**Structural checks:**
- [ ] All 11 categories swept (including #10 marked "not applicable" if appropriate)
- [ ] Total findings 8-15
- [ ] Priority distribution roughly 3-5 / 4-6 / 1-4
- [ ] Findings sorted by ICE descending within each priority group
- [ ] Samenvatting (executive summary) 100-150 words, no duplication of findings content
- [ ] No separate "Brand context" section (brand snapshot is internal only)
- [ ] Each finding 150-350 words
- [ ] Test roadmap max 4 sprints, max 4 tests per sprint
- [ ] Audit limitations 3-6 bullets

**Per-finding checks:**
- [ ] Visual confirmation for any "missing element" finding
- [ ] No runtime-state claims without visual evidence
- [ ] No authenticity claims (don't call phone broken, response-time false, routing-form misroutes without evidence)
- [ ] Decision-maker context respected (not consumer-style recommendations)
- [ ] Account-routing logic acknowledged where relevant
- [ ] Multi-stakeholder routing calibrated as nuance, not always Critical
- [ ] Account-management category marked "not applicable" where appropriate
- [ ] Sales-team-time-cost context applied to lead-quality recommendations
- [ ] WhatsApp/chat recommendations calibrated to brand formality (acceptable MKB, often not enterprise)
- [ ] No length labels in output
- [ ] Translated jargon check (no "huren" in Dutch JTBD)
- [ ] Diagnosis cites a specific principle, study, or source
- [ ] Recommendation matches brand snapshot AND B2B-service-type AND organization-size
- [ ] ICE justified by I/C/E breakdown with category-specific calibration applied

**Language check (HARD):**
- [ ] Entire audit in ONE committed language (no mixed NL/EN, DE/EN, FR/EN, etc.)
- [ ] `.nl` TLD + Dutch content → audit fully in Dutch (not English with Dutch quotes)
- [ ] `.de` TLD + German content → audit fully in German
- [ ] B2B sites in English regardless of TLD → audit in English (match dominant content language)
- [ ] All section headings, all findings, all hypotheses, all CTA suggestions in committed language

**High-risk claim verification (HARD).** Some findings have a history of being wrong when based on HTML interpretation. For these specific claim types, the finding may only be included if you can quote or describe the exact visual evidence from the screenshot in the diagnosis itself.

**High-risk claim categories:**
- Contact-route labels and presence (sales/support/partner/media buttons visible?)
- Phone number visible / tap-to-call functional
- Form-field count, labels, or routing-logic
- Chat-widget presence and status
- Response-time displays / "we respond within X" promises
- Office addresses, vestigingen-listing
- Trust badges or certifications visible

**Verification format in diagnosis:** "Visible in screenshot: [specific element described]." If you cannot write that sentence based on what's in the screenshot, the finding is removed.

Hypothetical example: do NOT write *"De pagina toont drie contact-routes: Sales, Support, Partners"* unless you can write *"Visible in screenshot: drie contact-cards horizontaal naast elkaar met de labels 'Sales', 'Support', 'Partners' elk met eigen CTA-knop."*

If any box is unchecked, rework or remove the finding before delivering. False findings destroy audit credibility. One verified finding beats three unverified ones.

### Step 7: Deliver the report

Use this exact structure. Total report should feel scannable, not exhaustive — the lezer ziet binnen 30 seconden de essentie en duikt dan in findings voor de inhoud.

```markdown
# B2B Contact Page CRO Audit — [Brand]

## Samenvatting
[100-150 words. Structure:
- One-sentence overall verdict (what is the page doing well/badly at the highest level)
- Three Critical issues as bullets — title only, NO explanation (each gets its own full finding below)
- One closing sentence with B2B-service-type + organization-size detection + account-state of screenshots
No duplication with content that appears in findings. No "combined directional impact" lines. No marketing prose.]

## Category sweep
[One-line status per category: Findings (critical/important/nice) / No findings — [brief reason] / Not assessable — [reason]. Note: Account-management contact may be marked "Not applicable to this business-type".]

## Findings
### 🔴 Critical findings
### 🟠 Important findings
### 🟢 Nice-to-have findings

## Test roadmap suggestion
[Max 4 sprints. Note that B2B contactpage test-windows depend heavily on traffic volume — most B2B contactpages have lower traffic than servicepages or homepages, so test-windows may stretch 6-12 weken. Downstream sales-cycle progression takes much longer to attribute.]

## Audit limitations
[3-6 bullets. Include honest note about downstream sales-attribution being slower than direct contact-conversion metrics.]

---

**Export options — kies wat je wilt:**

📄 **Client-rapport (.docx)** — Word-document met volledige audit.

📊 **Sprint-planning (.xlsx)** — Spreadsheet met één regel per finding.

Je kunt één, beide of geen kiezen. Laat het weten.
```

### Step 8: Generate exports on request

**Communication rule:** the user sees only `Exports worden gegenereerd...` during generation. No process narration. No XML-error commentary.

**Use the official skills.** Always read `/mnt/skills/public/docx/SKILL.md` and `/mnt/skills/public/xlsx/SKILL.md` before generating.

**.docx structure:** cover page (with B2B-service-type + organization-size), samenvatting, category sweep, findings grouped by priority, test roadmap, audit limitations.

Common XML pitfall: never wrap table cell arrays in extra array — `children: [cell1, cell2]`, not `children: [[cell1, cell2]]`.

**.xlsx columns (exact order):** ID | Priority | Category | Short title | Hypothesis | Primary metric | Expected impact | ICE score | Impact | Confidence | Ease | Source | Status

Findings sorted by ICE descending. Auto-filter on all columns. Header row bold. Freeze top row.

**Both:** docx first, then xlsx. Brief closing confirmation only.

**Neither:** end audit without generating exports.

## What this skill explicitly does NOT do

- **No SEO audit** (Organization schema, NAP consistency, Google Business — out of scope except where directly impacts on-page conversion signals)
- **No full accessibility audit** — only where it impacts conversion
- **No CRM/marketing-automation integration audit** — only the UX of the contact-routes, not the backend routing-logic
- **No paid-traffic audit** — only the page itself
- **No competitor audit** — only the page provided
- **No B2C contact page audit** (use landingpage-b2c-leadgen-contactpage)
- **No B2B servicepage audit** (use landingpage-b2b-leadgen-servicepage)
- **No B2B homepage audit** (use landingpage-b2b-leadgen-homepage when available)
- **No B2B aboutus audit** (use landingpage-b2b-leadgen-aboutus when available)
- **No dedicated campaign LP audit** (use landingpage-b2b-leadgen-dedicatedlp)
- **No B2B ecom page audit** (use landingpage-b2b-ecom-* skills)
- **No assumptions about invisible functionality** — check first

## Audit tone

- Direct and concrete
- Source-backed for every claim
- No assumptions about non-visible context (especially organization-size and service-type)
- Calls out B2B-service-type-specific exceptions
- Avoids unexplained CRO or B2B jargon
- Respects decision-maker context (no consumer-style recommendations)
- Calibrates account-routing recommendations to organization-size
- Marks account-management contact "not applicable" appropriately
- Honest about lower attribution-confidence on downstream sales-impact
