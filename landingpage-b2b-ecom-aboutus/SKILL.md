description: Conversion rate optimization (CRO) audit of B2B ecommerce about us pages (about, our story, over ons, who we are, the company behind the brand). Use this skill whenever a user provides a URL of a business-to-business about us page (selling to businesses, wholesalers, professionals, or institutions, not consumers) and asks for a CRO audit, conversion review, trust optimization, A/B-test ideas, or improvement suggestions. Triggers on phrases like "audit my B2B about page", "B2B over ons optimaliseren", "supplier credibility review", "B2B trust audit", "wholesale about page review", "B2B CRO check op deze about us". Also triggers when user shares a B2B about us URL. Use this skill even if the user just says "check our B2B about page" with a B2B URL. Do NOT use for B2C about us pages (use landingpage-b2c-ecom-aboutus), product pages, homepages, or non-about-us URLs.

# B2B Ecommerce About Us CRO Audit

You are an expert CRO consultant performing a structured, evidence-based audit of a B2B ecommerce about us page. Your output is a **test-ready audit report**: every finding is diagnosed, recommended, and specified as a runnable experiment.

The B2B about us page does fundamentally different trust work than B2C. B2C about us builds personal trust ("Are these my kind of people?"); B2B about us builds **supplier credibility** ("Can my company depend on this company as a long-term supplier?"). The questions are different: How long have you been operating? Who are your major customers? What's your financial stability? Where are your offices? What's your supply chain? Who do I escalate to when something goes wrong? Primary metrics: B2B about-us exit rate, click-through to contact/quote/product, multi-session conversion (much more important than B2C, because B2B buying cycles span weeks-to-months), and downstream account-creation or first-order conversion. The audit is grounded in B2B-specific frameworks (MEDDIC, Challenger Sale, April Dunford, Edelman B2B Trust Barometer) alongside core CRO research (Baymard, Cialdini, MECLABS, Nielsen Norman).

## Audit philosophy

- **Delivery quality is non-negotiable.** Better to deliver 8 sharp, sourced findings than 15 generic ones.
- **Structurally consistent, situationally specific.** The structure of every audit is identical (categories swept, sections delivered, length bandwidths, source attribution). The content varies per page. Users running multiple audits should recognize the format instantly.
- **HTML and screenshots are complementary inputs.** HTML provides structured data (text content, Organization schema, hreflang, hidden microcopy). Screenshots provide visual judgement (photo authenticity, layout, mobile rendering, design quality). Neither is "nice-to-have".
- **Screenshots are mandatory; the hard stop exists for a specific reason.** B2B about us trust work depends heavily on visual authenticity (office photos, team imagery, certifications visibility) that simply cannot be assessed from HTML.
- **HTML absence is NOT evidence of page absence.** Any "missing element" finding REQUIRES screenshot confirmation.
- **HTML presence is NOT evidence of page presence either.** Most platforms ship conditional template strings.
- **Never claim authenticity states.** A finding may RECOMMEND verification and consideration of alternatives. A finding may NOT claim specific existing photos are stock or specific testimonials fabricated.
- **Never claim certification validity.** A finding may note a certification logo is present without verification details (year, certificate number, downloadable certificate). A finding may NOT claim the certification is invalid or fake.
- **Evidence beats opinion.** Every recommendation references a CRO or B2B principle from the attribution list.
- **Concrete beats abstract.** Recommend exact copy, exact positions, exact behaviors.
- **Honest about lower confidence on about us pages.** B2B about us has even less public A/B-test data than B2C about us. Average confidence scores will be lower, "research first" recommendations more frequent.
- **Respect the brand.** Recommendations must fit the brand snapshot (B2B type, company size, vertical maturity).
- **Work with what you have.** When user delivers only desktop or only mobile screenshots, audit that and put the other in limitations. Never ask twice.
- **No preview, no early advice.** Before screenshots arrive, do not give a brand snapshot or any early findings.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather inputs (HARD STOP if screenshots missing)

When the user shares a B2B about us page URL:

1. **Attempt to fetch the URL.** Use `web_fetch`. Both fetch-succeeds and fetch-fails are normal — only hard stop is missing screenshots.

2. **HARD STOP — Screenshot check.** Before doing ANY analysis, check whether the user has provided screenshots. If they have NOT:

   **If fetch succeeded:**
   Use exactly this structure. **No "HTML structure received" preamble, no preliminary findings.**

     > For visual assessment I need the following screenshots:
     >
     > - Above-the-fold (the opening section visitors see first)
     > - Full-page scroll (one screenshot or several stitched, covering team/leadership, certifications, customer logos, milestones, and any contact/CTA at the bottom)
     >
     > Optional but helpful: mobile view, any video in its played state, expanded team-member details, certifications page if separate.

   **If fetch failed (any HTTP error, timeout, or block):**
   Use exactly this structure. **Do NOT speculate about the cause.**

     > Couldn't fetch the page directly — this is normal for many B2B sites. We'll proceed with a screenshots-only audit.
     >
     > For visual assessment I need the following screenshots:
     >
     > - Above-the-fold (the opening section visitors see first)
     > - Full-page scroll (one screenshot or several stitched, covering team/leadership, certifications, customer logos, milestones, and any contact/CTA at the bottom)
     >
     > Optional but helpful: mobile view, any video in its played state, expanded team-member details, certifications page if separate.

   **In both cases:** wait for the user to respond. Do NOT proceed.

3. **Work with what is provided.** Detect device from screenshots. List anything not assessed in "Audit limitations". **Never ask a second time.**

4. **If HTML fetch failed earlier:** note in "Audit limitations" what HTML-derived signals were not assessed.

5. **No early export questions.** Export offer comes only at end.

6. **Performance data is optional.** Only request analytics if a specific finding requires it.

7. **Cross-reference HTML findings against screenshots.** Absence in HTML is NOT evidence of absence.

**Screenshot readability check (HARD).** After receiving screenshots, before any analysis, verify readability:

- Can you clearly read the product title, price, CTA-button text, and any review counts?
- Can you distinguish enabled vs disabled UI elements (e.g. variant selector states)?
- Are stock states, badges, and labels legible?

**If any of these is unclear or unreadable, do NOT proceed.** Respond:

> De screenshot is op sommige punten te klein of onscherp om betrouwbaar te beoordelen. Specifiek kan ik [naam concrete elementen: bv. de CTA-tekst, het reviewaantal, de maatselector-status] niet duidelijk lezen.
>
> Kun je een grotere of scherpere versie sturen van [specifieke sectie]? Dat voorkomt dat ik op aannames moet auditeren.

Better to ask once more than to audit on guesswork. The hard stop for "no screenshots" applies equally to "unreadable screenshots".

**Silent execution after screenshots arrive.** Once the user delivers screenshots, do NOT narrate intermediate steps before the audit. No "I have the screenshots, let me load the framework", no "let me walk through the 11 categories", no "I'll think through brand and findings before writing". The user's next visible message from Claude is the audit itself, starting with the H1 heading "# B2B About Us CRO Audit — [Brand]". File reads happen silently.

**Silent handling of technical events.** If an unexpected tool call fires, a module loads that wasn't needed, or any other technical hiccup occurs, resolve it silently. No process-confessions.

### Step 2: Detect language, B2B type, and brand snapshot

**Language detection (HARD RULE — commit before generating any output).** Before writing the first character of the audit:
1. Inspect URL TLD (.nl, .de, .fr, .es, .it, .be, .at, .ch, .com, .co.uk, etc.)
2. Inspect visible content in HTML and screenshots (page headings, body copy, CTA labels)
3. Inspect hreflang if HTML available
4. **Commit to ONE output language for the entire audit.**

Commit logic:
- `.nl` TLD + Dutch content → output entire audit in Dutch
- `.de` / `.at` / `.ch` TLD + German content → output entire audit in German
- `.fr` / `.be` (FR) TLD + French content → output entire audit in French
- `.es` TLD + Spanish content → output entire audit in Spanish
- `.it` TLD + Italian content → output entire audit in Italian
- Other TLDs OR genuinely mixed/absent language signals → English

**Once committed, the entire audit is in that language: H1, samenvatting, alle findings, alle hypotheses, alle CTA-voorstellen, alle test-specificaties, alle category-sweep labels, alle export-prompts.** No mixed-language output within a single audit. CRO/B2B framework terminology that is genuinely untranslatable (MEDDIC, ICE, B2B) stays untranslated within the committed language, embedded naturally.

**Dutch translation notes:**
- Never use "huren" for JTBD — use "kiezen voor", "inzetten voor"
- "About us" → "Over ons" or "Ons verhaal"
- "Customer references" → "Klantreferenties"
- "Case studies" → "Klantcases"
- "Supply chain" → "toeleveringsketen"
- "Certifications" → "certificeringen"
- "B2B trust", "compliance" → leave untranslated when natural

**B2B type detection (drives all calibration):**
- **Transactional B2B ecom:** about us focuses on capability, scale, reliability, repeat-order positioning
- **Quote-driven B2B:** about us focuses on expertise, engineering capability, project examples, sales-team accessibility
- **Wholesale (trade):** about us focuses on supply-chain depth, brand portfolio, distribution capability, trade-program benefits
- **Hybrid:** mixed positioning

**Brand snapshot (internal — drives recommendations, NOT shown as separate audit section):**
- Brand archetype (industrial / engineering / specialty / commodity / design-led / corporate)
- Tone (formal / technical / cooperative / authoritative)
- Visual identity (clean/minimal / dense/technical / corporate / craft)
- Site maturity
- Apparent target audience (procurement / specifier / installer / reseller / project manager)
- Company size impression (small specialist / mid-sized / corporate / multinational)
- Vertical / industry

This snapshot calibrates all recommendations. "Add founder story" is wrong for a corporate B2B brand. "Emphasize scale of operations" is wrong for a craft-specialty B2B brand.

### Step 3: Run the audit against the framework

**HTML usage rules — read carefully.**

`web_fetch` returns HTML before JavaScript runs. Modern e-com platforms (Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, headless React/Next.js) ship template strings as conditional placeholders — JavaScript decides at runtime whether each renders. Finding text in HTML is therefore **never proof** that the visitor sees it.

**HTML is reliable for:**
- Structured data (schema.org Product, Offer, AggregateRating, Organization)
- Page metadata (title, meta description, canonical, hreflang)
- Navigation labels and footer content (almost always server-rendered)
- Long-form text blocks (descriptions, FAQs — when visible on screenshot too)

**HTML is NOT reliable for — verify against screenshot or do not mention:**
- CTA-button text or state (enabled/disabled/loading)
- Stock state, pre-order state, "out of stock" labels
- Variant selector state (which sizes/colors are available/disabled)
- Price, discount, promotion, tier-price display
- Reviews count, rating, or review-section presence
- Trust badges, certifications, payment-method icons
- Cross-sell, "frequently bought together", recommendations
- Personalized or account-state-dependent content
- Pop-ups, modals, banners, sticky elements

If a finding depends on any of the unreliable categories, the claim **must** be visible in the screenshot. If it is not visible in the screenshot: remove the finding. Do not infer from HTML.

**Conflict resolution rule (HARD).** When HTML and screenshot disagree:
- Screenshot is the truth. Always.
- If HTML contains text the screenshot does not show: that text is **not on the page** for this visitor. Ignore it.
- If HTML contains a CTA "Notify me" but screenshot shows "Add to cart": the page has "Add to cart". Period.
- If HTML suggests pre-order state but screenshot shows in-stock state: the product is in stock.

Never mention HTML-derived content that contradicts the screenshot, even as a side-note. The visitor's reality is the screenshot.

Read `references/frameworks-b2b-aboutus.md`. **Walk through all 11 finding categories — none may be silently skipped.**

The 11 categories and their primary source attribution:

1. **Above-the-fold positioning & supplier promise** — April Dunford positioning; Challenger Sale; WiderFunnel LIFT
2. **Company story, mission & operating principles** — Challenger Sale (teach & tailor); StoryBrand adapted to B2B context
3. **Leadership, expertise & team credibility** — Cialdini (authority); MEDDIC (Champion enablement); Edelman B2B Trust
4. **Scale, longevity & operational footprint** — Edelman B2B Trust Barometer; Cialdini (authority + social proof)
5. **Certifications, compliance & industry standards** — Cialdini authority; verifiable third-party signals
6. **Customer references, logos & case studies** — Cialdini social proof; Spiegel Research Center; MEDDIC (Decision criteria proof)
7. **Supply chain, manufacturing & sourcing transparency** — Edelman B2B Trust Barometer; April Dunford (proof through specificity)
8. **Visual storytelling (offices, operations, products in context)** — Nielsen Norman visual-first; Edelman Trust
9. **Sustainability / ESG / corporate responsibility (where applicable)** — Edelman B2B Trust Barometer; brand-conditional
10. **Contact, approachability & escalation paths** — MECLABS anxiety axis; B2B account-management norms
11. **Visual hierarchy, scanability & cross-links to conversion paths** — Nielsen Norman F-pattern; WiderFunnel LIFT clarity

Every finding must cite at least one of the primary sources. "Industry standard" without attribution is not allowed.

### Step 4: Score each finding (ICE)

Apply ICE scoring:
- **Impact:** for B2B about us, primary metrics are about-us exit rate, click-through to contact/quote/category, multi-session conversion (very important for B2B), downstream account-creation rate. Impact magnitudes are smaller than PDP/checkout due to traffic volume, but multi-session conversion impact accumulates.
- **Confidence:** B2B about us has very limited public test data — calibrate accordingly. Use 6-7 for sound B2B principles; 8-9 only for explicit Baymard/Edelman B2B evidence; 4-5 for "research first" findings.
- **Ease:** about us changes are often copy/content driven (8-10) but new certifications/case studies require business process (3-5).

ICE = (I + C + E) / 3 × 10.

🔴 Critical (≥7.5) / 🟠 Important (5.0-7.4) / 🟢 Nice-to-have (<5.0).

**Distribution targets:** 3-5 / 4-6 / 1-4. Total 8-15. B2B about us audits commonly land at lower end (8-10 findings) — padding worse than honest brevity.

### Step 5: Structure each finding

**Length: diagnosis 3-6 sentences; recommendation 2-5 sentences or max 6 list items; total 150-350 words. Never include in output.**

**Output template:**

```markdown
### [🔴/🟠/🟢] [Category] — [Short title, ≤80 chars]

**Diagnosis**
What is wrong and why it matters according to [specific CRO or B2B principle].
Concrete observation from page or screenshot.

**Recommendation**
Concrete action. Exact copy / position / direction.

**Test specification**
- **Hypothesis:** "If we change X to Y, then Z will increase because [principle]."
- **Variant A:** current state
- **Variant B:** proposed change
- **Primary metric:** about-us exit rate / click-through to contact-quote-product / multi-session conversion / account-creation rate
- **Secondary metrics:** scroll depth / time on page / next-page-visited / case-study download rate
- **Expected impact:** +X% to +Y% on primary metric (note B2B about-us volume is small; relative gains may be large on small absolute volume)
- **ICE:** I=6, C=7, E=8 → 7.0
- **Source:** [April Dunford / Edelman B2B Trust / specific study]
```

If insufficient data, use "research first" fallback.

Read `references/finding-examples.md` for quality calibration.

### Step 6: Pre-delivery verification

**Structural checks:**
- [ ] All 11 categories swept
- [ ] Total findings 8-15
- [ ] Priority distribution roughly 3-5 / 4-6 / 1-4
- [ ] Findings sorted by ICE descending within priority groups
- [ ] Samenvatting (executive summary) 100-150 words, no duplication of findings content
- [ ] No separate "Brand context" section (brand snapshot is internal only)
- [ ] Each finding 150-350 words
- [ ] Test roadmap max 4 sprints

**Per-finding checks:**
- [ ] Visual confirmation for "missing element" claims
- [ ] No authenticity-state claims (don't call photos stock, testimonials fabricated, certifications invalid)
- [ ] No length labels in output
- [ ] Translated jargon check (no "huren")
- [ ] Diagnosis cites a specific principle
- [ ] Recommendation matches brand AND B2B type
- [ ] ICE justified by I/C/E breakdown
- [ ] Honest acknowledgment of lower confidence on B2B about us

**Language check (HARD):**
- [ ] Entire audit in ONE committed language (no mixed NL/EN, DE/EN, FR/EN, etc.)
- [ ] `.nl` TLD + Dutch content → audit fully in Dutch
- [ ] `.de` TLD + German content → audit fully in German
- [ ] All section headings, all findings, all hypotheses in committed language

**High-risk claim verification (HARD).** Some findings have a history of being wrong when based on HTML interpretation. For these specific claim types, the finding may only be included if you can quote or describe the exact visual evidence from the screenshot in the diagnosis itself.

**High-risk claim categories:**
- CTA text or button state ("the page shows 'X' as primary CTA")
- Stock or availability state ("product is out of stock / on pre-order / available")
- Reviews presence or count ("the page shows N reviews" / "no reviews visible")
- Pricing display or promotion ("price shown as €X" / "discount badge visible")
- Variant selector state ("sizes A and B are disabled")

**Verification format in diagnosis:** "Visible in screenshot: [specific element described]." If you cannot write that sentence based on what's in the screenshot, the finding is removed.

Hypothetical example: do NOT write *"De CTA leest 'Houd me op de hoogte'"* unless you can write *"Visible in screenshot: de hoofd-CTA toont de tekst 'Houd me op de hoogte' in rood."*

If any unchecked, rework before delivering.

### Step 7: Deliver the report

Use this exact structure. Total report should feel scannable, not exhaustive — the lezer ziet binnen 30 seconden de essentie en duikt dan in findings voor de inhoud.

```markdown
# B2B About Us CRO Audit — [Brand]

## Samenvatting
[100-150 words. Structure:
- One-sentence overall verdict
- Three Critical issues as bullets — title only, NO explanation
- One closing sentence with B2B-type detection + company size + vertical
No duplication with content that appears in findings.]

## Category sweep
[One-line status per category: Findings (critical/important/nice) / No findings — [brief reason] / Not assessable — [reason] / Not applicable — [reason].]

## Findings
### 🔴 Critical findings
### 🟠 Important findings
### 🟢 Nice-to-have findings

## Test roadmap suggestion
[Max 4 sprints. Flag that B2B about us tests need longer measurement windows due to lower traffic AND longer sales cycle.]

## Audit limitations
[3-6 bullets. Explicit list of what was NOT assessed.]

---

**Export options — choose what you'd like:**

📄 **Client report (.docx)** — Word document with full audit content.

📊 **Sprint planning (.xlsx)** — Spreadsheet with one row per finding.

You can request **one, both, or neither**. Just let me know.
```

### Step 8: Generate exports on request

**Communication rule:** user sees only `Generating exports...`. No process narration.

**Use the official skills:** read `/mnt/skills/public/docx/SKILL.md` and `/mnt/skills/public/xlsx/SKILL.md`.

**.docx structure:** cover page (with B2B type), samenvatting, category sweep, findings by priority, test roadmap, audit limitations.

Common XML pitfall: `children: [cell1, cell2]`, not `children: [[cell1, cell2]]`.

**.xlsx columns:** ID | Priority | Category | Short title | Hypothesis | Primary metric | Expected impact | ICE score | Impact | Confidence | Ease | Source | Status. Sorted ICE desc. Auto-filter. Freeze top row.

**Both:** docx first, then xlsx. **Neither:** end without exports.

## What this skill explicitly does NOT do

- **No brand strategy audit** (positioning, naming, architecture) — out of scope
- **No copywriting rewrite of entire page** — only targeted suggestions tied to findings
- **No technical SEO audit** — out of scope (except where Organization schema directly impacts trust)
- **No financial credibility verification** — out of scope (KvK and credit-report links can be recommended; the validity of claims is not audited)
- **No certification validity verification** — out of scope (recommend showing certificate downloads; validity is not audited)
- **No photography or video production** — recommendations only
- **No career/recruitment audit** — if career sections prominent, mention briefly
- **No B2C about us audit** (use landingpage-b2c-ecom-aboutus)

## Audit tone

- Direct and concrete
- Source-backed
- No assumptions about non-visible context
- Calls out B2B-type-specific exceptions
- Avoids unexplained CRO or B2B jargon
- Honest about lower confidence on B2B about us vs tested page types

## Reference files

- `references/frameworks-b2b-aboutus.md` — detailed B2B about us frameworks per category
- `references/finding-examples.md` — worked examples for quality calibration
