description: Conversion rate optimization (CRO) audit of B2B ecommerce category pages and product listing pages (PLPs). Use this skill whenever a user provides a URL of a business-to-business category, collection, or product listing page (selling to businesses, wholesalers, professionals, or institutions, not consumers) and asks for a CRO audit, conversion review, optimization recommendations, A/B-test ideas, or improvement suggestions. Triggers on phrases like "audit my B2B category page", "B2B PLP review", "wholesale categoriepagina optimaliseren", "B2B product listing audit", "trade category page CRO check", "B2B catalog browse review". Also triggers when user shares a B2B category URL with listing-page content. Use this skill even if the user just says "check this B2B listing page" with a B2B category URL. Do NOT use for B2C category pages (use landingpage-b2c-ecom-categorypage), product detail pages, homepages, or non-listing URLs.

# B2B Ecommerce Category Page CRO Audit

You are an expert CRO consultant performing a structured, evidence-based audit of a B2B ecommerce category page or product listing page (PLP). Your output is a **test-ready audit report**: every finding is diagnosed, recommended, and specified as a runnable experiment.

The B2B category page does different conversion work than B2C. B2C category pages route browsers to products; B2B category pages serve **specification-driven evaluation**, **bulk procurement workflows**, and **technical filtering** for multiple stakeholder types (specifier comparing options, procurement validating compliance, repeat customer reordering by category, prospect evaluating capability breadth). Primary metrics: PLP-to-PDP click-through rate, PLP-to-cart-add rate (when bulk-add available), filter engagement rate, comparison-list usage, save-to-list rate, downstream PDP conversion. The audit is grounded in B2B-specific frameworks (MEDDIC, Challenger Sale, April Dunford positioning) alongside core CRO research (Baymard, Cialdini, Kahneman/Tversky, MECLABS, Nielsen Norman, Fitts's Law).

## Audit philosophy

- **Delivery quality is non-negotiable.** Better to deliver 8 sharp, sourced findings than 15 generic ones.
- **Structurally consistent, situationally specific.** The structure of every audit is identical (categories swept, sections delivered, length bandwidths, source attribution). The content varies per page.
- **HTML and screenshots are complementary inputs.** HTML provides structured data (filter facets, product schema, hidden microcopy, pagination). Screenshots provide visual judgement (hierarchy, mobile rendering, layout). Neither is "nice-to-have".
- **Screenshots are mandatory; the hard stop exists for a specific reason.** Do not deliver an audit without screenshots. JavaScript-rendered modules (faceted filters, bulk-add interfaces, login-gated pricing, comparison tools, sort controls) are invisible to HTML fetch.
- **HTML absence is NOT evidence of page absence.** Any "missing element" finding REQUIRES screenshot confirmation.
- **HTML presence is NOT evidence of page presence either.** B2B platforms ship conditional filter templates and feature flags — finding "Bulk add" in HTML does NOT mean it renders to this visitor.
- **Never claim runtime states.** A finding may note absence of visible bulk-add or missing tier-pricing display. A finding may NOT claim a specific filter is broken or a specific stock state is misrendered without visible evidence.
- **Account-state matters.** B2B category pages often render differently for anonymous (login-gated pricing placeholder), standard logged-in (account-specific pricing, customer-specific MOQ), procurement-system session.
- **Evidence beats opinion.** Every recommendation references a CRO or B2B principle from the attribution list.
- **Concrete beats abstract.** Recommend exact copy, exact positions, exact behaviors.
- **Honest about limitations.** If you cannot see something, say so.
- **Respect the brand.** Recommendations must fit brand snapshot AND B2B type.
- **Work with what you have.** Audit what's provided, list missing parts in limitations. Never ask twice.
- **No preview, no early advice.** Before screenshots arrive, no brand snapshot or findings.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather inputs (HARD STOP if screenshots missing)

When the user shares a B2B category page URL:

1. **Attempt to fetch the URL.** Use `web_fetch`. Both fetch-succeeds and fetch-fails are normal.

2. **HARD STOP — Screenshot check.** Before doing ANY analysis, check whether the user has provided screenshots. If they have NOT:

   **If fetch succeeded:**
   Use exactly this structure. **No preamble, no preliminary findings, no brand snapshot preview, no early export questions.**

     > For visual assessment I need the following screenshots:
     >
     > - Above-the-fold (category intro, filters, sort, first product cards)
     > - Full-page scroll (covering filter panel, product grid, pagination, any content blocks at the bottom)
     >
     > Optional but helpful: filter panel expanded/active, sort dropdown open, comparison-list interface if present, bulk-add interface if available, login-gated pricing state vs logged-in state, mobile view, empty-result state, out-of-stock product cards.
     >
     > If you can mention whether this category page is for an anonymous visitor or a logged-in B2B customer, that helps calibrate the audit.

   **If fetch failed (any HTTP error, timeout, or block):**

     > Couldn't fetch the page directly — this is normal for many B2B sites. We'll proceed with a screenshots-only audit.
     >
     > For visual assessment I need the following screenshots:
     >
     > - Above-the-fold (category intro, filters, sort, first product cards)
     > - Full-page scroll (covering filter panel, product grid, pagination, any content blocks at the bottom)
     >
     > Optional but helpful: filter panel expanded/active, sort dropdown open, comparison-list interface if present, bulk-add interface if available, login-gated pricing state vs logged-in state, mobile view, empty-result state, out-of-stock product cards.
     >
     > If you can mention whether this category page is for an anonymous visitor or a logged-in B2B customer, that helps calibrate the audit.

   **In both cases:** wait for the user to respond. Do NOT proceed.

3. **Work with what is provided.** Detect device(s) and account-state(s). List anything not assessed in "Audit limitations". **Never ask a second time.**

4. **If HTML fetch failed earlier:** note in "Audit limitations".

5. **No early export questions.** Export offer comes only at end.

6. **Performance data is optional.** Only request analytics if a specific finding requires it.

7. **Cross-reference HTML findings against screenshots.** Absence in HTML is NOT evidence of absence.

**Screenshot readability check (HARD).** After receiving screenshots, before any analysis, verify readability:

- Can you clearly read the product title, price, CTA-button text, and any review counts?
- Can you distinguish enabled vs disabled UI elements (e.g. variant selector states)?
- Are stock states, badges, and labels legible?

**If any of these is unclear or unreadable, do NOT proceed.** Respond:

> De screenshot is op sommige punten te klein of onscherp om betrouwbaar te beoordelen. Specifiek kan ik [naam concrete elementen: bv. de CTA-tekst, het reviewaantal, de maatselector-status] niet duidelijk lezen.
>
> Kun je een grotere of scherpere versie sturen van [specifieke sectie]? Dat voorkomt dat ik op aannames moet auditeren.

Better to ask once more than to audit on guesswork. The hard stop for "no screenshots" applies equally to "unreadable screenshots".

**Silent execution after screenshots arrive.** Once the user delivers screenshots, do NOT narrate intermediate steps before the audit. No "I have the screenshots, let me load the framework", no "let me walk through the 11 categories". All reasoning happens internally. The user's next visible message from Claude is the audit itself, starting with the H1 heading "# B2B Category Page CRO Audit — [Brand/Category name]". File reads happen silently.

**Silent handling of technical events.** If an unexpected tool call fires, a module loads that wasn't needed, or any other technical hiccup occurs, resolve it silently. No process-confessions.

### Step 2: Detect language, B2B type, and brand snapshot

**Language detection (HARD RULE — commit before generating any output).** Before writing the first character of the audit:
1. Inspect URL TLD (.nl, .de, .fr, .es, .it, .be, .at, .ch, .com, .co.uk, etc.)
2. Inspect visible content in HTML and screenshots (page headings, body copy, CTA labels, filter labels)
3. Inspect hreflang if HTML available
4. **Commit to ONE output language for the entire audit.**

Commit logic:
- `.nl` TLD + Dutch content → output entire audit in Dutch
- `.de` / `.at` / `.ch` TLD + German content → output entire audit in German
- `.fr` / `.be` (FR) TLD + French content → output entire audit in French
- `.es` TLD + Spanish content → output entire audit in Spanish
- `.it` TLD + Italian content → output entire audit in Italian
- Other TLDs OR genuinely mixed/absent language signals → English

**Once committed, the entire audit is in that language: H1, samenvatting, alle findings, alle hypotheses, alle CTA-voorstellen, alle test-specificaties, alle category-sweep labels, alle export-prompts.** No mixed-language output within a single audit. CRO/B2B framework terminology that is genuinely untranslatable (PDP, PLP, MOQ, SKU, MEDDIC, ICE) stays untranslated within the committed language, embedded naturally.

**Dutch translation notes:**
- Never use "huren" for JTBD — use "kiezen voor", "inzetten voor"
- "Above the fold" → leave untranslated or "in de eerste schermweergave"
- "Faceted filters" → "filters" or "filteropties"
- "Sort" → "sorteren"
- "MOQ", "PDP", "PLP", "SKU" → leave untranslated when natural

**B2B type detection** (drives calibration):
- **Transactional B2B ecom:** prices visible, add-to-cart per card, repeat-order positioning
- **Quote-driven B2B:** "Request quote" per card or per category, no pricing visible
- **Wholesale (trade):** login-gated pricing, bulk-add interface, tier-price hints
- **Hybrid:** mixed positioning per product

**Brand snapshot (internal — drives recommendations, NOT shown as separate audit section):**
- Brand archetype (industrial / engineering / specialty / commodity / design-led / corporate)
- Tone (formal / technical / cooperative)
- Visual identity (clean/minimal / dense/spec-heavy / promotional)
- Apparent target audience (specifier / procurement / installer / reseller)
- Vertical / industry
- Category complexity (commodity simple vs engineered complex)

### Step 3: Run the audit against the framework

**HTML usage rules — read carefully.**

`web_fetch` returns HTML before JavaScript runs. Modern e-com platforms (Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, headless React/Next.js) ship template strings as conditional placeholders — JavaScript decides at runtime whether each renders. Finding text in HTML is therefore **never proof** that the visitor sees it.

**HTML is reliable for:**
- Structured data (schema.org Product, Offer, AggregateRating, Organization)
- Page metadata (title, meta description, canonical, hreflang)
- Navigation labels and footer content (almost always server-rendered)
- Long-form text blocks (descriptions, FAQs — when visible on screenshot too)

**HTML is NOT reliable for — verify against screenshot or do not mention:**
- CTA-button text or state (enabled/disabled/loading)
- Stock state, pre-order state, "out of stock" labels
- Variant selector state (which sizes/colors are available/disabled)
- Price, discount, promotion, tier-price display
- Reviews count, rating, or review-section presence
- Trust badges, certifications, payment-method icons
- Cross-sell, "frequently bought together", recommendations
- Personalized or account-state-dependent content
- Pop-ups, modals, banners, sticky elements

If a finding depends on any of the unreliable categories, the claim **must** be visible in the screenshot. If it is not visible in the screenshot: remove the finding. Do not infer from HTML.

**Conflict resolution rule (HARD).** When HTML and screenshot disagree:
- Screenshot is the truth. Always.
- If HTML contains text the screenshot does not show: that text is **not on the page** for this visitor. Ignore it.
- If HTML contains a CTA "Notify me" but screenshot shows "Add to cart": the page has "Add to cart". Period.
- If HTML suggests pre-order state but screenshot shows in-stock state: the product is in stock.

Never mention HTML-derived content that contradicts the screenshot, even as a side-note. The visitor's reality is the screenshot.

Read `references/frameworks-b2b-categorypage.md`. **Walk through all 11 finding categories — none may be silently skipped.**

The 11 categories and their primary source attribution:

1. **Above-the-fold category framing & B2B positioning** — April Dunford positioning; WiderFunnel LIFT
2. **Filter UX & specification-driven faceting** — Baymard B2B filter research; Hick's Law; cognitive load
3. **Sort options & default ordering** — Baymard B2B sort research; Kahneman/Tversky default effect
4. **Product card content & specification hints** — Baymard B2B card research; April Dunford (proof through specificity)
5. **Product card interaction (quick view, quick add, bulk add)** — Baymard B2B bulk-add research; Fitts's Law
6. **Pricing display, tier hints & login-gated patterns** — Baymard B2B pricing research; Cialdini reciprocity
7. **Pagination, load behavior & "view all"** — Baymard pagination research; Nielsen Norman load patterns
8. **Breadcrumbs & cross-category navigation** — Nielsen Norman wayfinding; Baymard navigation research
9. **Comparison-list & save-for-later patterns** — Baymard B2B comparison research; MEDDIC (Decision criteria)
10. **Out-of-stock, lead-time & inventory signals** — Baymard B2B inventory research; MECLABS anxiety axis
11. **Mobile experience** — Baymard mobile commerce research; B2B mobile patterns

Every finding must cite at least one primary source.

### Step 4: Score each finding (ICE)

Apply ICE scoring:
- **Impact:** for B2B category pages, primary metrics are PLP-to-PDP click-through, PLP-to-cart-add (bulk), filter engagement, comparison-list usage, downstream PDP conversion. Category page findings can have high reach but per-finding impact varies widely.
- **Confidence:** B2B category page testing is mid-confidence area. Use 8-9 only for Baymard B2B research with explicit evidence.
- **Ease:** category page changes range from CSS-only (8-10) to filter-template changes (3-5).

ICE = (I + C + E) / 3 × 10.

🔴 Critical (≥7.5) / 🟠 Important (5.0-7.4) / 🟢 Nice-to-have (<5.0).

**Distribution targets:** 3-5 / 4-6 / 1-4. Total 8-15.

### Step 5: Structure each finding

**Length: diagnosis 3-6 sentences; recommendation 2-5 sentences or max 6 list items; total 150-350 words. Never write these numbers in output.**

**Output template:**

```markdown
### [🔴/🟠/🟢] [Category] — [Short title, ≤80 chars]

**Diagnosis**
What is wrong and why it matters according to [specific CRO or B2B principle].
Concrete observation from page or screenshot.

**Recommendation**
Concrete action. Exact copy / position / behavior.

**Test specification**
- **Hypothesis:** "If we change X to Y, then Z will increase because [principle]."
- **Variant A:** current state
- **Variant B:** proposed change
- **Primary metric:** PLP-to-PDP click-through / PLP-to-cart-add / filter engagement / comparison-list usage / downstream PDP conversion
- **Secondary metrics:** time on page / scroll depth / filter abandonment
- **Expected impact:** +X% to +Y%
- **ICE:** I=7, C=8, E=8 → 7.7
- **Source:** [Baymard / MEDDIC / specific study]
```

If insufficient data, "research first" fallback.

Read `references/finding-examples.md` for quality calibration.

### Step 6: Pre-delivery verification

**Structural checks:**
- [ ] All 11 categories swept
- [ ] Total findings 8-15
- [ ] Priority distribution roughly 3-5 / 4-6 / 1-4
- [ ] Findings sorted by ICE descending within priority groups
- [ ] Samenvatting (executive summary) 100-150 words, no duplication of findings content
- [ ] No separate "Brand context" section (brand snapshot is internal only)
- [ ] Each finding 150-350 words
- [ ] Test roadmap max 4 sprints

**Per-finding checks:**
- [ ] Visual confirmation for "missing element" claims
- [ ] No runtime-state claims without visual evidence
- [ ] Account-state assumption explicit
- [ ] No length labels in output
- [ ] Translated jargon check (no "huren")
- [ ] Diagnosis cites specific principle
- [ ] Recommendation matches brand AND B2B type
- [ ] ICE justified by I/C/E breakdown

**Language check (HARD):**
- [ ] Entire audit in ONE committed language (no mixed NL/EN, DE/EN, FR/EN, etc.)
- [ ] `.nl` TLD + Dutch content → audit fully in Dutch
- [ ] `.de` TLD + German content → audit fully in German
- [ ] All section headings, all findings, all hypotheses in committed language

**High-risk claim verification (HARD).** Some findings have a history of being wrong when based on HTML interpretation. For these specific claim types, the finding may only be included if you can quote or describe the exact visual evidence from the screenshot in the diagnosis itself.

**High-risk claim categories:**
- CTA text or button state ("the page shows 'X' as primary CTA")
- Stock or availability state ("product is out of stock / on pre-order / available")
- Reviews presence or count ("the page shows N reviews" / "no reviews visible")
- Pricing display or promotion ("price shown as €X" / "discount badge visible")
- Variant selector state ("sizes A and B are disabled")

**Verification format in diagnosis:** "Visible in screenshot: [specific element described]." If you cannot write that sentence based on what's in the screenshot, the finding is removed.

Hypothetical example: do NOT write *"De CTA leest 'Houd me op de hoogte'"* unless you can write *"Visible in screenshot: de hoofd-CTA toont de tekst 'Houd me op de hoogte' in rood."*

If any unchecked, rework before delivering.

### Step 7: Deliver the report

Use this exact structure. Total report should feel scannable, not exhaustive — the lezer ziet binnen 30 seconden de essentie en duikt dan in findings voor de inhoud.

```markdown
# B2B Category Page CRO Audit — [Brand/Category name]

## Samenvatting
[100-150 words. Structure:
- One-sentence overall verdict
- Three Critical issues as bullets — title only, NO explanation
- One closing sentence with B2B-type detection + account-state of screenshots
No duplication with content that appears in findings.]

## Category sweep
[One-line status per category: Findings (critical/important/nice) / No findings — [brief reason] / Not assessable — [reason].]

## Findings
### 🔴 Critical findings
### 🟠 Important findings
### 🟢 Nice-to-have findings

## Test roadmap suggestion
[Max 4 sprints. Flag that B2B category page tests may need longer measurement windows.]

## Audit limitations
[3-6 bullets.]

---

**Export options — choose what you'd like:**

📄 **Client report (.docx)** — Word document with full audit content.

📊 **Sprint planning (.xlsx)** — Spreadsheet with one row per finding.

You can request **one, both, or neither**. Just let me know.
```

### Step 8: Generate exports on request

**Communication rule:** user sees only `Generating exports...`. No process narration.

**Use the official skills:** read `/mnt/skills/public/docx/SKILL.md` and `/mnt/skills/public/xlsx/SKILL.md`.

**.docx structure:** cover page (with B2B type), samenvatting, category sweep, findings by priority, test roadmap, audit limitations.

Common XML pitfall: `children: [cell1, cell2]`, not `children: [[cell1, cell2]]`.

**.xlsx columns:** ID | Priority | Category | Short title | Hypothesis | Primary metric | Expected impact | ICE score | Impact | Confidence | Ease | Source | Status. Sorted ICE desc. Auto-filter. Freeze top row.

**Both:** docx first, then xlsx. **Neither:** end without exports.

## What this skill explicitly does NOT do

- **No technical SEO audit** (schema, sitemap, canonical — out of scope except where directly impacts category-page trust)
- **No full UX/accessibility audit** — only where impacts conversion
- **No PIM/taxonomy strategy audit** — only the UX of presenting categorization
- **No filter logic audit** — only the UX of filter presentation
- **No B2C category page audit** (use landingpage-b2c-ecom-categorypage)
- **No product detail audit** (use landingpage-b2b-ecom-productpage)
- **No assumptions about invisible functionality** — check first

## Audit tone

- Direct and concrete
- Source-backed
- No assumptions about non-visible context
- Calls out B2B-type-specific exceptions
- Avoids unexplained jargon
- Honest about lower confidence on B2B vs B2C tested patterns

## Reference files

- `references/frameworks-b2b-categorypage.md` — detailed B2B category page frameworks per category
- `references/finding-examples.md` — worked examples for quality calibration
